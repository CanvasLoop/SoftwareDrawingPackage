# Software Drawing Package: Experimental

Goal is to achieve a 2D software rendering engine written in vanilla JavaScript. 

The obvious performance drawbacks will be mitigated as follows:
- Caching mechanisms
- Pre-processing and pre-computed acceleration tables
- Modern application programming techniques
- JavaScript fastest approach

Target Features:
- Software rasterizer for triangles, lines, and other shapes
- Able to read Fonts and render text
- 8-bit sub pixel antialiasing
- Full support for transparency

Extremely early stages...
